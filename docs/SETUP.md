# Setup

## Requirements

Only Docker and Docker Compose are required on the host. Go commands run inside
Docker through the Makefile.

## Configuration

Copy the committed template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `MONDAY_API_TOKEN` to an API token created in monday.com's developer
settings. Keep the token only in `.env` or a secret manager; `.env` is ignored
by Git.

`MONDAY_API_VERSION` is sent as Monday's `API-Version` HTTP header. The default
`2026-07` is the current stable version documented by Monday at the time this
repository was initialized. Check the [Monday API versioning
documentation](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs/api-versioning)
before upgrading it. Do not use a release candidate in production.

## Run

```bash
make build
make run
```

The MCP server uses stdio. Its stdout is reserved for MCP JSON-RPC traffic and
logs are written to stderr.

## Validation

```bash
make test
make fmt-check
make vet
make validate
```

All commands execute in Docker or Docker Compose; no Go installation is
required on the host.

GitHub Actions mirrors this Docker-first validation: the Go checks build the
builder image and run formatting, module-integrity verification, tests, and
`go vet` inside it. The security workflow runs a repository secret scan on
pull requests, pushes to `main`, and the weekly schedule.

The GraphQL transport retries only transient network failures, HTTP 429, and
HTTP 5xx responses. Retries are bounded by `MCP_MAX_RETRIES` and honor a
bounded `Retry-After` header. GraphQL validation errors and other permanent
HTTP errors are returned without retrying.
